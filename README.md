# Caolan Leatham‑Orrell

Modern Web Developer for SMBs — Next.js • Tailwind CSS • GSAP

I build fast, accessible, SEO‑ready websites and web apps that help small and medium‑sized businesses convert better and scale with confidence. I emphasize modern web development and best practices—performance, accessibility, clean architecture, and maintainability—so teams can ship quickly and iterate safely.
